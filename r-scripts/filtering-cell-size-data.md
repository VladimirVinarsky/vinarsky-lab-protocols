# Filtering cell-size data

## How do I want to use it?

1. sketch the graph I want to have on paper
2. select the type of the graph I want to use
3. select the experimental conditions I am interested in
4. select the measurment I want to plot
5. export the table in a form which can be saved and used in graph-pad with all values
6. export the summary table in a form which can be used in graph pad.
7. In case I want to make a graph in R:
8. shuffle the conditions around to have them displayed in the form I want

## Example dataset for plotting

WT FN vs MG from katka data

```
# filtering plot for WT on FN and MG from Katka experiments
 
```

## what graphs do I have and want to have?

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Figure2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Neither YAP1 KO or YAP1 WT respond to different stiffness on PDMS

### YAP1 WT cardiomyocytes are bigger than KO

#### Conditions

```
// Some code
```

types of graph:

1. violins side by side, one for KOs, one for WTs
2. all together, two violins
3. faceted by experiment

### YAP1 WT respond to stretching by change in size, but the KO do not

### YAP1 WT respond to FN by change in size, buth the KO do not

### YAP1 WT response to actuation and fn can be inhibited

### YAP1 shuttles to nucleus after stretch, FN, but can  be inhibited
